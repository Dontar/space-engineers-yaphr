Y.A.P.H.R - Yet another Pistons, Hinges, and Rotors control script.

Are you tired of jerky hinges, twitchy rotors, and clanging pistons?
Are you tired of weird and unintuitive configurations and setups?
Are you tired of recompiling after every little change?

Y.A.P.H.R is here to help!
Now with support for Profiles!!!

Initial setup
-------------
* Setup all of the blocks comprising the crane in "{Yaphr} Crane" group.
  The script will put configuration in the programmable block CustomData.
* Add the "{Yaphr}" tag to your screen/cockpit. It can be put either in the name or in CustomData, the script will check both.
  This is only necessary for the script to show its menu. For cockpits multi screens put "@1-n" to the cockpit CustomData.
  Example "@1" first screen, "@2" second and so on. You can even combine the tag and the screen index like this "{Yaphr}@2".
* Load the script into your Programmable Block and bind the "up"/"down"/"apply" commands to your bar (just like PAM).
* As soon as the menu shows on the configured screen you'r good to go.
